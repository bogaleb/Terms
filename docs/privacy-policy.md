# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: October 1, 2025_

This Privacy Policy explains how EtBook ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects information when you use our mobile application and related services (the "Service").

## 1. Introduction
We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and handling your data responsibly. By using the Service, you agree to the practices described below.

## 2. Information We Collect
- **Account data:** name, email, and profile details you provide
- **Business & bookkeeping data:** organizations, books, entries, attachments, and configuration you create
- **Device & diagnostics:** device model, OS version, app version, and lightweight analytics/diagnostics
- **Optional content:** photos or documents you attach (for example, receipts)
- **Usage data:** interactions with features (exports, reports) and timestamps for in-app audit visibility

## 3. How We Use Information
- Provide, maintain, and enhance the Service
- Support collaboration across organizations and businesses you belong to
- Secure the app via PIN/biometric access and detect suspicious behaviour
- Respond to support requests and troubleshoot issues
- Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms

## 4. Data Storage & Security
We apply industry-standard safeguards, including encrypted transport and secure device storage for secrets (such as the app lock PIN hash). Exported files stay on your device unless you explicitly share them. You are responsible for safeguarding exports.

## 5. Sharing & Third Parties
We do not sell personal information. We may share data:
- Within your organization, according to roles and permissions
- With infrastructure/service providers operating under contractual obligations
- When required by law, to protect rights, or to prevent harm

## 6. Your Choices & Controls
- **App lock:** enable/disable PIN and biometrics in Security & Privacy
- **Auto-lock timeout:** choose when the app requires re-authentication
- **Export/import:** manage local backups of your bookkeeping data
- **Access/correction:** update profile and business information in Settings
- **Deletion:** delete your account under Settings -> Data Management -> Delete account

## 7. Data Retention
We retain information while your account is active and as needed to provide the Service. You may export your data at any time. If you delete your account, we remove or anonymise data unless retention is required by law or legitimate interests (for example fraud prevention).

## 8. International Users
Our infrastructure may operate in multiple regions. By using the Service you consent to processing and storage in the locations where we and our providers operate, subject to appropriate safeguards.

## 9. Children's Privacy
The Service is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Contact us if you believe a child has provided data so we can delete it.

## 10. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy. Material changes will be communicated in-app or via email, and become effective when the new "Last updated" date is posted.
