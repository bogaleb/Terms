# iOS Device Testing - Quick Start Guide

Since you have a paid Apple Developer account, here's the fastest way to test your EtBook app on iOS:

## üöÄ Quick Testing Options

### Option 1: Expo Go (Fastest - 2 minutes)
**For rapid prototyping and basic testing**

1. **Install Expo Go** on your iOS device from the App Store

2. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

3. **Scan QR code** with Expo Go app

**Limitations**: Won't include custom native code (expo-dev-client, biometrics, etc.)

### Option 2: Development Build (Best for full testing)
**For complete feature testing with all native code**

#### Step 1: Fix Apple Developer Account
First, verify your Apple Developer account:

1. Go to https://developer.apple.com/account/
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Check that your membership shows "Active" 
4. Note your **Team ID** (looks like: ABC123DEF4)

#### Step 2: Manual Credential Setup
If automatic setup fails, we can configure manually:

```bash
# Set your Team ID in eas.json first
eas credentials --platform ios
```

Then select "Manual" setup and provide:
- Distribution Certificate
- Provisioning Profile
- Apple Team ID

#### Step 3: Build and Install

```bash
# Build for device
eas build --platform ios --profile preview

# Or build for simulator (if you have macOS)
eas build --platform ios --profile development --local
```

## üîß Apple Developer Account Setup

Since your account seems to have team issues, let's verify:

1. **Check Account Status**:
   - https://developer.apple.com/account/
   - Membership should show "Active"
   - Annual fee should be paid

2. **Get Your Team ID**:
   - In Apple Developer Portal, look for "Team ID" 
   - It's usually in format: ABC123DEF4

3. **Update eas.json** with your Team ID:
   ```json
   {
     "submit": {
       "production": {
         "ios": {
           "appleTeamId": "YOUR_ACTUAL_TEAM_ID"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## üéØ Recommended Testing Flow

For your EtBook app, I recommend this sequence:

1. **Quick Test**: Use Expo Go for basic functionality
2. **Full Test**: Build development profile for complete testing
3. **Beta Test**: Use TestFlight for team/user testing
4. **Production**: Submit to App Store

## üì± Current Alternatives

While we resolve the credential issue, you can:

### Test in Browser (Web Version)
```bash
expo start --web
```

### Test in iOS Simulator (if you have macOS)
```bash
expo start --ios
```

### Use Physical Android Device (if available)
```bash
expo start --android
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Verify Developer Account**:
   - Check https://developer.apple.com/account/
   - Ensure membership is active
   - Note your Team ID

2. **Clear EAS Cache**:
   ```bash
   eas build --clear-cache
   ```

3. **Manual Credentials**:
   ```bash
   eas credentials --platform ios
   ```

4. **Alternative Build**:
   ```bash
   # Try without specific profile
   eas build --platform ios
   ```

## üìû Next Steps

1. **Check your Apple Developer Portal** for Team ID
2. **Try Expo Go** for immediate testing
3. **Update eas.json** with correct Team ID
4. **Retry build** with proper credentials
