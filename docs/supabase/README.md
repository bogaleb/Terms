# Supabase docs (operator notes)

This folder captures ad-hoc SQL you ran manually and any archived drafts.

- `archive/supabase_migration_v2.sql` — Large draft migration with a different naming scheme (orgs/org_members). Do not run against the current schema. Preserved for reference.
- `../..//supabase/schema` — Canonical schema used by the app. Refer to `supabase/README.md` for how to apply.
