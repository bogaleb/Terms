# EtBook Testing & QA Strategy

## Overview
Comprehensive testing strategy to ensure production reliability, data integrity, and user experience quality.

## Testing Pyramid

### 1. Unit Tests (Foundation)
- **Coverage Target**: 80%+ for critical business logic
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Subscription service logic
  - Data validation and transformation
  - Business rule enforcement
  - Utility functions

### 2. Integration Tests (Core)
- **Database Operations**: CRUD operations with proper isolation
- **Sync Functionality**: Data synchronization between local/cloud
- **Authentication Flow**: Login, logout, session management
- **Subscription System**: Feature gating and usage limits

### 3. End-to-End Tests (Critical Paths)
- **User Onboarding**: Registration → Organization setup → First business
- **Business Management**: Create → Invite users → Collaborate
- **Transaction Flow**: Create → Edit → Sync → Reports
- **Subscription Upgrade**: Free → Professional → Feature access

## Test Categories

### A. Data Isolation Tests ⚠️ CRITICAL
- **Multi-tenant isolation**: Verify users only see their organization's data
- **Business boundaries**: Ensure business members can't access other businesses
- **Sync isolation**: Confirm sync only downloads authorized data
- **Cross-contamination**: Test switching organizations doesn't leak data

### B. Subscription & Feature Gating Tests
- **Usage limits**: Verify free tier limits are enforced
- **Feature access**: Test premium features are gated correctly
- **Upgrade flow**: Validate subscription changes update permissions
- **Usage tracking**: Confirm accurate billing data collection

### C. Performance & Reliability Tests
- **Sync performance**: Large dataset synchronization
- **Memory management**: Long-running session stability
- **Network resilience**: Offline/online transition handling
- **Database integrity**: Concurrent access and conflict resolution

### D. Security Tests
- **Authentication bypass**: Attempt unauthorized access
- **Data exposure**: SQL injection and XSS prevention
- **API security**: Rate limiting and input validation
- **Session management**: Token expiration and refresh

## Test Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Security & Data Integrity
1. Multi-tenant isolation test suite
2. Authentication and authorization tests
3. Data validation and sanitization tests
4. Subscription enforcement tests

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
1. Business management workflows
2. Transaction CRUD operations
3. Sync reliability and conflict resolution
4. User collaboration features

### Phase 3: Performance & Edge Cases
1. Large dataset handling
2. Network failure scenarios
3. Concurrent user operations
4. Memory and resource management

## Test Data & Environment Strategy

### Test Data Sets
- **Small**: 1 org, 2 businesses, 50 transactions
- **Medium**: 3 orgs, 10 businesses, 500 transactions
- **Large**: 10 orgs, 50 businesses, 5000+ transactions
- **Edge**: Empty states, maximum limits, special characters

### Environment Management
- **Local Development**: SQLite with seed data
- **Staging**: Supabase staging with production-like data
- **Production**: Limited testing with synthetic data only

## Quality Gates & Metrics

### Code Quality Requirements
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% for business logic
- **TypeScript**: Zero type errors
- **ESLint**: Zero violations for critical rules
- **Performance**: Bundle size under 5MB

### Acceptance Criteria
- All critical path tests pass
- No data isolation failures
- Subscription limits work correctly
- Performance meets benchmarks
- Security vulnerabilities resolved

## Testing Tools & Framework

### Test Runner: Jest + React Native Testing Library
### E2E: Detox (React Native)
### Mock Data: Factory pattern with realistic scenarios
### CI Integration: GitHub Actions with parallel test execution

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas (Require Extra Testing)
1. **Multi-tenant data isolation** - Business critical
2. **Subscription billing accuracy** - Revenue critical
3. **Data synchronization reliability** - User trust critical
4. **Performance under load** - User experience critical

### Medium Risk Areas
1. UI component behavior
2. Form validation
3. Error handling
4. Offline functionality

### Low Risk Areas
1. Static content rendering
2. Basic navigation
3. Simple calculations
4. Styling consistency

## Monitoring & Observability

### Production Monitoring
- **Error tracking**: Sentry integration
- **Performance monitoring**: Expo analytics
- **User behavior**: Custom analytics events
- **Business metrics**: Subscription conversions

### Health Checks
- Database connectivity
- Sync service availability
- Authentication service status
- Third-party integrations

## Test Automation Strategy

### Continuous Integration
- Run unit tests on every commit
- Integration tests on PR creation
- E2E tests on staging deployment
- Performance tests on release candidates

### Test Scheduling
- **Smoke tests**: Every deployment
- **Regression tests**: Weekly
- **Load tests**: Before major releases
- **Security scans**: Monthly

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Goals
- 95%+ test pass rate
- <2% false positive rate
- <5 second test suite execution
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities

### Qualitative Goals
- Developers confident in deployments
- QA team can validate features efficiently
- Product team has reliable release pipeline
- Support team has debugging tools

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Foundation
- Set up testing infrastructure
- Create test data factories
- Implement critical security tests

### Week 2: Core Features
- Business management tests
- Transaction workflow tests
- Sync functionality tests

### Week 3: Integration & E2E
